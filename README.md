# Streetnight
A 3D game where the user tries to collect coins in the dark. Streetlamps light things up, while
trains can damage you if you get hit. Use w,a,s,d, and spacebar to move around.

## Build Instructions
If you are on windows, you need to download freeglut, make the
directory C:/Program Files/Common Files/freeglut/, copy the 
include/ and lib/ folders from freeglut into there, and copy
freeglut.dll from freeglut/bin/ into the cmake-build-debug/ folder.

If you are not on windows, maybe it will just work.
